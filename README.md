# ðŸš€ Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms built entirely from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of these models by coding them from the ground up, without relying on high-level machine learning libraries.

## âœ¨ Features
âœ… Implementations of fundamental ML algorithms
âœ… Focus on mathematical foundations and efficiency
âœ… No external ML libraries, only NumPy and core Python

## ðŸ“Œ Implemented Algorithms
- **ðŸ”¢ Linear Regression**: Uses matrix operations for efficient computation and supports multiple features (multivariate regression). Optimized with gradient descent for parameter tuning.
- **ðŸ§  Logistic Regression** *(Coming soon!)*: Implements binary classification using the sigmoid function and gradient-based optimization.

This project is a continuous learning journeyâ€”stay tuned for more algorithms! ðŸš€
